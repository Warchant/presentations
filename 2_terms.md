**unit test**

The purpose of a unit test is to verify the behavior of a relatively small piece of software, independently from other parts. Unit tests are narrow in scope, and allow us to cover all cases, ensuring that every single part works correctly.

+++

**integration test**

On the other hand, integration tests demonstrate that different parts of a system work together in the real-life environment. They validate complex scenarios (we can think of integration tests as a user performing some high-level operation within our system), and usually require external resources, like databases or web servers, to be present.

+++

**regression test**

Refers to the practice of comparing the results of running a program given a specific input with a fixed set of expected results, in order to verify that the program continues to behave as expected from one version to the next.

+++

**system test**

System testing of software or hardware is testing conducted on a complete, integrated system to evaluate the system's compliance with its specified requirements.
System testing falls within the scope of black-box testing, and as such, should require no knowledge of the inner design of the code or logic.

+++

*white-box testing*

Refers to the practice of verifying the expected behavior of a component by exploiting knowledge of its underlying implementation.

*black-box testing*

Refers to the practice of verifying the expected behavior of a component based solely on its specification (without knowledge of its implementation).
